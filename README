In here are some useful variations on a central script that automates a lot of simple tasks in Gromacs, along with the supplementary files necessary to run the chosen examples.

Examples (by folder name):

(1) AAPMF
	Uses Gromacs 4.6.7 to generate configurations (from pulling simulations) and .sge scripts for umbrella simulations and PMF calculations of stripped NDI cores in implicit solvent at atomistic levels of resolution.
(2) CGPMF
	Uses Gromacs 4.6.7 to generate configurations and .sge scripts for umbrella simulations and PMF calculations of DMFI-OPV3-IFMD.  Includes additional code to automatically check histogram coverage and setup further runs as well as continued runs.
 
(3) CGassembly
	Uses Gromacs 5.0 to equilibrate and simulate 50 molecules of the DMFI-OPV3-IFMD chemistry at a Martini level of resolution.  Currently the main script works for any DX1X2X3-OPV3-X3X2X1D chemistry when appropriately modified.
