A set of live scripts.  A lot of them may have issues loading the data they call to, but we can see if there's a way we can host that data in a useful place--this might be something to chat with Andy about, I don't know if you're going to have access to our cluster at UIUC.  However, even those that can't be run because they require extra data should show you the basic idea of how I think about analyzing data sometimes.
