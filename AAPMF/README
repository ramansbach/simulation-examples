This is pretty similar to the CG PMF version; the files are similar, so mostly look to CGpmf for the description.  Having said that, this does contain forcefield and topology files as well as construction for atomistic using Charmm27.  Bryce Thurston should be completing some other more general code for computing atomistic topologies (and he has atomistic code for different cores.)
